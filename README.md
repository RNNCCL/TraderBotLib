TraderBotLib
============

This repository currently contains a class for scraping stock metrics and a class for simulating buying/selling stocks. 

See code comments for more details.


Updates to be made: 

-Right now, using the library might require setting timeouts, so I'll probably add asynchronous functions. 

-Avoid redundant substring copies

-Find site page that has less content
